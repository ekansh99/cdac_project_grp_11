# cdac_project_grp_11

The project is a portable telematics device that collects real-time vehicle data. Using SPI, UART, and Bluetooth, it captures and transmits NO2 emissions, speed, and x, y, z axis and temperature data. This information is securely transmitted to the cloud. The system runs on FreeRTOS for efficient data acquisition and supports over-the-air (OTA) firmware updates. Machine learning processes the data like temperature, speed, NOx emissions to predict engine issues. This valuable insight allows for dynamic insurance pricing based on driving behavior and environmental impact.
